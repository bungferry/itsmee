# IT'S MEE

This directory is a brief example of a [Its'mee](https://itsmee.vercel.app/) site that can be deployed to Vercel with zero-configuration. If you need to use API Routes, we recommend using our [It's mee example](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/sveltekit).

## Deploy Your Own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/svelte&template=svelte)

_Live Example: https://itsmee.vercel.app/_

## Getting Started

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template my-svelte-project
cd my-svelte-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
